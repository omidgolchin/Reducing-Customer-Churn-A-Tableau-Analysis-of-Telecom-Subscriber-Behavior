# Reducing Customer Churn: A Tableau Analysis of Telecom Subscriber Behavior
In this Tableau case study, we analyze customer churn for a telecom company facing a churn rate of 22.12%. By leveraging interactive dashboards, calculated fields, and visualizations like dual-axis graphs and scatter plots, we uncover key drivers of churn.

The primary goal of this project is to investigate the reasons behind Databel's high customer churn rate (22.12%) and identify actionable insights to help the company retain its subscribers. Using Tableau's dynamic visualization capabilities, we explore demographic trends, contract types, payment methods, and usage patterns that influence churn rates.
# Data Overview:
The dataset contains information on 6,280 customers, including demographics, subscription details, payment methods, and usage statistics. The overall churn rate is 22.12%, with significant variations across specific demographics and service categories:
Seniors have a 10% higher churn rate than the average.
California residents experience an alarming 62% churn rate.
Month-to-month contracts account for nearly half of all churned customers (48%).
# Methodology:
- Data Exploration: Cleaned data was imported into Tableau for analysis.
- Calculated Fields: Created calculated fields to measure churn percentages across demographics, contract types, and service categories.
- Visualizations: Developed dual-axis graphs to compare churn rates across demographics and contract types; scatter plots to analyze correlations between usage patterns and churn; and bar charts to highlight payment method trends.
- Dynamic Dashboards: Incorporated filters and parameters for interactive exploration of the data.
- Storytelling: Combined insights into a cohesive Tableau Story for easy communication.
# Key Results:
## Demographic Insights:
Seniors are 10% more likely to churn compared to other age groups.
California residents show an extremely high churn rate of 62%, indicating potential regional issues or competitive pressures.
## Contract Types:
Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate at 48%, suggesting that customers on flexible plans are more likely to leave.
## Churn Drivers:
Competitor influence is the leading cause of customer loss.
Customers with unused international plans or limited data usage (&lt;5 GB) on unlimited plans are more likely to leave.
## Group Plans:
Being part of a group plan reduces the odds of churning by an impressive 80%, highlighting the value of bundled services.
## Payment Methods:
Direct debit payments are linked to higher churn among month-to-month customers, despite being convenient.
# Implications for Business:
Targeted Retention Strategies: Focus retention efforts on high-risk groups like seniors and California residents by offering personalized incentives or loyalty programs.
- Contract Adjustments: Encourage customers on month-to-month contracts to switch to longer-term plans through discounts or added benefits.
- Service Optimization: Promote better utilization of international plans and unlimited data services through targeted communication campaigns or plan adjustments.
- Competitor Analysis: Conduct deeper research into competitor offerings in California to address regional challenges.
- Group Plan Promotion: Actively market group plans as a cost-effective option for customers to reduce churn likelihood.

By addressing these key drivers of churn with targeted strategies, Databel can significantly improve customer retention rates, reduce revenue losses, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. This Tableau project provides a comprehensive roadmap for understanding and combating customer churn in subscription-based businesses.
